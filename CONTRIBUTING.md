### Reporting bugs
If you think you've found a bug, please report it! It really helps to build a better software.

* Check the [Issues](https://github.com/grych/drab/issues) on Github to ensure that this one was not already reported
* Open a new [issue](https://github.com/grych/drab/issues) with the problem description and following information:
    - version of Elixir, Phoenix and Drab
    - code samples

** If you don't want to create an issue on Github, please report it directly to <grych@tg.pl> **

### Correct docs: fix typos, syntax etc
Drab needs help with the documentation: it must be more clear to readers and checked for typos, sytax.

* Create a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/grych/drab/pulls) on Github without reporting it as a bug. Label it as `docs`

### Proposing changes
* Post the proposal on Drab's thread on [elixirforum.com](https://elixirforum.com/t/drab-phoenix-library-for-server-side-dom-access/3277)
